> Coordination repository of the development of the
  Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency framework

This repository [issue tracker] is used by the developers to coordinate efforts
towards making RTIC a great choice for embedded real-time development.

## RFCs

When the team deems it necessary the RFC process may be used to make decisions
or to design processes, user interfaces, APIs, etc.

Learn more about the Rust's RFC process (which is the same as our own) [here][rust-rfc].

[rust-rfc]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/

To create an RFC, simply:

- clone this repo to your own personal one
- copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-feature.md` (where "my-feature" is
  descriptive. Don't assign an RFC number yet)
- fill in the details of your RFC in that file
- Open an pull request with this repository
