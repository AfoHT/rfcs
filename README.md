## RFCs

When the team deems it necessary the RFC process may be used to make decisions or to design
processes, user interfaces, APIs, etc.

Learn more about the Rust's RFC process (which is the same as our own) [here][rust-rfc].

[rust-rfc]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/

To create an RFC, simply:
- clone this repo to your own personal one
- copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-feature.md` (where "my-feature" is
  descriptive. Don't assign an RFC number yet)
- fill in the details of your RFC in that file
- Open an pull request with this repository
