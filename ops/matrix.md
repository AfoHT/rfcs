# Matrix Operational Notes

The RTFM developers use the following Matrix room for our regular
meetings and community discussion:

[#rtfm-rs:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/!yafYEipFNsXDdwiHMT:matrix.org)

The document details the organization of the room.

## Administration

See the [Matrix Moderation Guide](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation)
for information on how Matrix administration and permissions work.

RTFM [core team](https://github.com/orgs/rtfm-rs/teams/devs) members are
channel administrators (PL100), responsible for both maintaining the channel as
required and enforcing the WG's Code of Conduct.

* Can send messages
* Can invite users
* Can change room settings
* Kick and ban users in violation of the Code of Conduct
* Can remove messages in violation of the Code of Conduct
* Can notify everyone
* Can modify widgets
* Can change room avatar
* Can change main address for the room
* Can change history visibility
* Can change room name
* Can change other users' permissions

All WG members may be channel moderators on request, responsible for enforcing
the WG's Code of Conduct.

* Can send messages
* Can invite users

For a WG member to request to become a channel moderator (or a new core team
member to become an administrator), they should contact a core team member
[via GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/rtfm-rs/teams/devs) with their
Matrix username (e.g., `@username:matrix.org`) to be given moderator
permissions.

All other room members have no special powers:

* Can send messages
