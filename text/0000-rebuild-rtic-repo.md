# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Size of git repository is too large due to historic CI-generated build artifacts.

In order to maintain a good user experience and not needlessly consume bandwidth/CI-time
a git history cleanup is warranted.

By using `git filter-repo` to delete the offending CI-build artifacts the size of the repo
can be reduced by a factor 600 and the number of trees by a factor 63.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The user experience downloading the repo is far from ideal with a ~180 MiB download.

Due to limitations of the current libgit2 implementation, see [Issue 3058][libgit2],
shallow clones are not supported in cargo [Issue 1171][cargo-shallow].

The size on disk is not the primary concern, the number of trees are the primary problem
according to [`git-sizer`][git-sizer].

On reasonable fast network the issue is not so prominent, but sometimes we
 do not have the luxury of fast connectivity:

The change of "Blobs - Total size" is significant, going from

```
| * Blobs                      |           |                                |
|   * Count                    |  1.84 M   | *                              |
|   * Total size               |  9.19 GiB |                                |
```

to

```
| * Blobs                      |           |                                |
|   * Count                    |  3.52 k   |                                |
|   * Total size               |  15.5 MiB |                                |
```

A similar reduction can be observed for trees, maximum entries changes from 3.30k to only 52.

The problem is that `git filter-repo` needs to rewrite history in order to achieve this.

# How We Teach This
[how-we-teach-this]: #how-we-teach-this

In order to prevent the reintroduction of old history into the newly cleaned repo the recommended solution
is to force all users to freshly clone the repo, see point 4 in [`git filter-repo`][git-filter-repo].

Looking at the `cortex-m-rtic` repo [GitHub insights network graph][gh-network] the majority of users have old forks.

Adding a large and bold note in README instructing users to cleanly clone it.

Why should we *not* do this?

Rewriting history is generally risky.

As noted in the Discussion section of the [man-pages][git-filter-repo] of `git filter-repo`,
rewriting history in a git project is tricky business.

This immediately becomes the ‚ÄúHard case‚Äù as indicated in [git-rebase documentation][git-rebase].

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

Not doing this a lot of junk will just pollute git history and make git slower than necessary.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?

How to best communicate the need to completely re-clone the repo.
